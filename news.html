          An Interview with the Producer of Pokémon Evolutions Andy Gose offers
          insight into the creation of Pokémon’s newest animated limited series.
          In September 2021, Pokémon released the first episode of a new limited
          series that celebrates 25 years of Pokémon. We spoke with Pokémon
          Evolutions producer Andy Gose about the process of creating this
          exciting animation. From the big-picture themes of the show to the
          small decisions that were made during development, Mr. Gose takes us
          deeper into its creation. You can watch all eight episodes of Pokémon
          Evolutions on Pokémon TV and the official Pokémon YouTube channel.

        Any good trainer knows that you can't learn unless you play the game.
        Being a good trainer is a long and complicated process which involves
        working with the pokémon you have in order to accumulate experience and
        catch more pokémon. The more one loses oneself in the pursuit of
        pokémon, the greater the rewards. Pokémon evolve, they grow stronger,
        and thus lead the trainer to greater captures and greater pursuits. And
        this is why I have chosen to build my paper as a hypertext. For me, as a
        writer, the circuitous path through Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand
        Plateaus has left me no alternative but to move myself through the
        material in a similar fashion. How can I move through the menagerie of
        concepts in an orderly fashion, and to what end? Why seek stasis in an
        always changing game? Instead, I have arranged ideas in any order,
        because there is no order, only movement through smooth space. This is
        only a game with no object but to move the reader.
