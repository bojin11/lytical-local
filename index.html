        <h2>It's me, Pokemon</h2>
        <p>
          Pokémon—short for pocket monsters—is the name of a game (really
          several) involving creatures called “pokémon” and “trainers.” Within
          the narrative of the game, the pokémon trainer catches pokémon in
          little holding containers (called “pokeballs”), and then uses those
          pokémon to fight other pokémon. On its surface, the fights have two
          reasons: 1) to weaken and capture wild pokémon, and 2) to defeat other
          pokémon trainers. The pokémon themselves are various, having different
          appearances, names, powers, potentials, weaknesses, and personalities.
          The actual form of the game, again, on its surface, takes several
          forms: 1) the card game, 2) the Gameboy versions, 3) the Nintendo 64
          version, 4) the cartoons and movies, and 5) the various toys,
          merchandise, and artifacts. How these various aspects figure in this
          discussion of play is the subject of this paper, and thus further
          elaboration is available in following sections.

        Any good trainer knows that you can't learn unless you play the game.
        Being a good trainer is a long and complicated process which involves
        working with the pokémon you have in order to accumulate experience and
        catch more pokémon. The more one loses oneself in the pursuit of
        pokémon, the greater the rewards. Pokémon evolve, they grow stronger,
        and thus lead the trainer to greater captures and greater pursuits. And
        this is why I have chosen to build my paper as a hypertext. For me, as a
        writer, the circuitous path through Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand
        Plateaus has left me no alternative but to move myself through the
        material in a similar fashion. How can I move through the menagerie of
        concepts in an orderly fashion, and to what end? Why seek stasis in an
        always changing game? Instead, I have arranged ideas in any order,
        because there is no order, only movement through smooth space. This is
        only a game with no object but to move the reader.
