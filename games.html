          Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining Pearl
        </p>
        <p>
          Developed by ILCA, Inc., and directed by Junichi Masuda (GAME FREAK)
          and Yuichi Ueda (ILCA), Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and Pokémon Shining
          Pearl enable fans to experience the original story and game features
          from Pokémon Diamond and Pokémon Pearl in a fresh way. The original
          games have been faithfully reproduced and colorfully revitalized for
          Nintendo Switch. The sense of scale of the towns and routes has been
          carefully preserved, and fans who played the original games will
          recognize many familiar places. These games are updated with the
          easy-to-understand, player-friendly conveniences introduced in recent
          Pokémon core series video games, in addition to up-close-and-personal
          Pokémon battle scenes. Trainers will choose either Turtwig, Chimchar,
          or Piplup to be their first partner Pokémon before setting off on
          their journey. Along the way, they will be able to encounter the
          Legendary Pokémon Dialga in Pokémon Brilliant Diamond and the
          Legendary Pokémon Palkia in Pokémon Shining Pearl.

        <p style="text-decoration: underline">Pokémon Legends: Arceus</p>
        <p>
          Pokémon Legends: Arceus The fun of exploring while catching Pokémon
          and filling in a Pokédex has always been a core part of the Pokémon
          video game series. Pokémon Legends: Arceus was developed with the
          desire to deliver an experience infused with new action and RPG
          elements that go beyond the framework established thus far, while
          honoring the core gameplay of past Pokémon titles. As Trainers explore
          the natural expanses in Pokémon Legends: Arceus, they’ll encounter
          Pokémon that call these grand vistas home. To catch wild Pokémon,
          players can study the Pokémon’s behaviors, sneak up to them, then
          throw Poké Balls. Players can also battle wild Pokémon with their ally
          Pokémon. By throwing the Poké Ball holding their ally Pokémon near a
          wild Pokémon, players will seamlessly enter battle. This new gameplay
          angle is intended to provide Trainers with an immersive experience.
          Pokémon Legends: Arceus brings Trainers to the vast Sinnoh region as
          it existed in the past, long before the setting for Pokémon Diamond
          and Pokémon Pearl was established. Rich in nature and with Mount
          Coronet towering at its heart, this is a Sinnoh unlike anything
          Trainers have experienced before as they embark to create the region’s
          first Pokédex. As they start off on their adventure, Trainers will be
          able to choose either Rowlet, Cyndaquil, or Oshawott as their first
          partner Pokémon. These three Pokémon arrived with a Pokémon Professor,
          who encountered them on research excursions to various regions.

        <p style="text-decoration: underline">New Pokémon Snap</p>
        <p>
          New Pokémon Snap New Pokémon Snap is a previously announced video game
          in which players will take on the role of a budding Pokémon
          photographer in the Lental region. There they will work with Professor
          Mirror, the region’s expert, on an ecological survey to photograph
          Pokémon thriving in nature. The game will be available on April 30,
          2021, on the Nintendo Switch family of systems. Wild Pokémon thrive on
          the islands of the Lental region, where environments can differ
          greatly, making for a variety of habitats where different Pokémon
          expressions and behaviors can be observed. Players will be able to get
          their attention by playing a melody or throwing fluffruit. They’ll
          also be able to use an Illumina orb (an invention of Professor
          Mirror’s) on Pokémon to witness something out of the ordinary. They
          can even use their camera to run scans, which can help them find
          hidden Pokémon or inspect their surroundings. As players keep
          researching a course, their research level there will increase, and
          they may discover Pokémon acting in different ways. Trainers may even
          encounter Legendary Pokémon or Mythical Pokémon. A photo’s score will
          be based on the subjects’ poses, how large they appear, how directly
          they’re facing the camera, and where they fall in frame. Each photo
          will get one to four stars, indicating how common or rare the behavior
          displayed is. Players will have to take many photos to fill out their
          Photodex, which is their collection of Pokémon photographs. Photos
          taken while conducting research can also be saved to a personal album,
          which is separate from the Photodex. When a course is completed,
          players can use the re-snap function to adjust the brightness, blur,
          zoom, and other aspects of their recently snapped photos. After photos
          are saved to the personal album, a photo-editing mode will enable
          players to customize their photos with stickers, frames, and filters.
          New Pokémon Snap also has several online features that enable players
          to share photos and compete with others around the world through
          ranking systems.

        Any good trainer knows that you can't learn unless you play the game.
        Being a good trainer is a long and complicated process which involves
        working with the pokémon you have in order to accumulate experience and
        catch more pokémon. The more one loses oneself in the pursuit of
        pokémon, the greater the rewards. Pokémon evolve, they grow stronger,
        and thus lead the trainer to greater captures and greater pursuits. And
        this is why I have chosen to build my paper as a hypertext. For me, as a
        writer, the circuitous path through Deleuze and Guattari's A Thousand
        Plateaus has left me no alternative but to move myself through the
        material in a similar fashion. How can I move through the menagerie of
        concepts in an orderly fashion, and to what end? Why seek stasis in an
        always changing game? Instead, I have arranged ideas in any order,
        because there is no order, only movement through smooth space. This is
        only a game with no object but to move the reader.
